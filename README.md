#sohams Git-Github

For better results every work needs to be very organized so as software development. 

Applications are not developed by a single developer. So Developers need a place where they can keep their code in a systematic fashion and share it with other developers in the team. That place where all the programs can be stored is called as a repository.

Git and Github are version control systems. They are the repositories for files mostly the source code written by the application developers.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Git is better than any other version control system in terms of performance and functionality.

It is used by big companies like Microsoft, google, facebook, linkedin, twitter, Netflix, android and eclipse. 

Git is installed and used locally on a computer. GitHub is a web based hosting service for version control where all the repositories are stored on the server and can be accessed online. GitHub is used by 31 million developers, it has 100 million repositories and 2.1 million businesses are using it. GitHub is now owned by Microsoft and it is used by Nasa, Walmart, airbnb, google, ibm, facebook, spotify and many for their development.
